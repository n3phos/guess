# guess

Themeguess is a trivia quiz webapp built with RoR and JavaScript. It
uses the youtube player API to load and playback videos and relies on a
IRC webchat for the player input. Users can upload their own quiz
questions and answers to add more content. The site looks currently a
bit boring but this could change in the future.

Here is a list of what future features could look like:
- Proper User authentication (Devise)
- Room creation ( is sort of implemented )
- Better game generation algorithm
- Point / score system on right guess
- Leaderbords
- Achievements
- Playlist creation

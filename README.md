# guess

The Site is currently very hacky and prototypical written and serves more as a concept. 
Here is a list of what future features could look like:
- User login / logout
- Room creation ( is sort of implemented )
- Room invitation
- Game generation algorithm
- Point / score system on right guess
- Leaderbords
- Achievements
- Playlist creation
